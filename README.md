# AssemblyExamples
I'm uploding some works I created in Assembly, you gotta now the basics to understand them

The repo contains 6 examples
  BinarioExamen:
    It converts the decimal number that the user writes into binary and prints it
  CuadriculaExamen:
    It just paints in the screen a table with '*'
  Cubo Magico Examen:
    This one reads a message from the user and then it does an encryption using the 
    "magic square" ("816 157 492")
  EliminarAyEs:
    This program reads what user writes and then it eliminates all the letters "a" and "e"s
  MatrixExamen:
    This one was made by a friend, it ask the user 16 numbers and then the program orders them
    in a matrix, it waits 10 seconds and prints another, same numbers different order as well as color
  RevisarDosCadenas:
    The user writes 2 messages, the program checks if they are equal, the program prints a 
    "Son diferentes" or "Son iguales" in the screen
